        <div class="subheading mb-5">Management Information SystemsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Rhea Dhadwal and I am a second year student at the University of California, Riverside, studying Management Information Systems with Business. As such, I am trying to obtain a summer internship, somewhere in this field. I have worked in the retail business for a few months. At the store, Designer Shoe Warehouse, I worked as a cashier. At, Designer Show Warehouse I worked in the financial aspect of the Dublin, CA branch. I helped out as a cashier and in taking inventory. I was also awarded employee of the month after only working there for two months, which is something I'm very proud of. I currently do not have much experience in the actual profession I would like to pursue, but I take pride in the jobs and experiences I have had because I've put my 100% in to it. Being a cashier showed me that I have a business oriented mindset and I have the capability to handle the financial well-being of branch which could translate to running the financials of a company. However, there is a software called Tableau in which I am trying to receive my certification. It is a tool that is highly utilized within the data analyst domain.  <br><br>

        While I do not have a lot of experience for my major, I make up for it in my other qualities. I am very hard-working and love to take on challenges. One of my most prolific qualities is my commitment. When I commit to something, I always follow through with it. In 2005, I started to play soccer and I committed to it and I kept playing soccer for 13 more years, all the way til my senior year of high school. On top of that, my leadership abilities far exceeds that of any other person. In high school, I was able to be Captain of our school's Bhangra Team, Foothill Bhangra, and Vice-President of our school's Bollywood team, Foothill Fizaa. Another quality that these teams have made me is a team-player. I am team-player as seen through my various dance, soccer team, work experiences and volunteer experiences. I believe that one of the most important things in our society is Community Service. The ability to serve and give back to our community is one of greatest things that we, as citizens, can do. I have done community service for various services like Dublin Pride Week, Tri-Valley Women's March, Donlon Elementary School in the School Smarts program and many more amazing causes. All of these great accolades show how well-rounded a person I am, and how I stay in balance with my professional and personal life. Also along with these great qualities, I am a people person. <br><br>

       I love talking to people and having great intellectual conversations with them. I find it fascinating how other people act and speak and studying their demeanor. It interests me also how to relate things like speech and demeanor towards business concepts, such as decision making. Here's how to contact me:
